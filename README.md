# COVID-19 Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts COVID-19 cases through a combination of Data Analysis (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. We analyze data to gain insights into the relationship between symptoms and COVID-19. The primary ML model used is RandomForest, offering a balanced approach.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis (DA):** Exploration of COVID-19 data to identify patterns.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizing the RandomForest algorithm for predictions.
- **Predictive Insights:** Providing insights into COVID-19 cases based on symptoms.
